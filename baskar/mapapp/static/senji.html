The Three Hills - The Three Citadels
As already mentioned the Gingee Fort complex is situated on three hillocks. In fact all the three hills together constitute a fort complex, yet 
each hill contains a separate and self contained fort. The first hill, where the main fort is located, is called Rajagiri. Originally it was known 
as Kamalagiri as well as Anandagiri. The fort here is most impregnable. It is about 800 ft. in height. Its summit is cut off from communication and
is surrounded by a deep, natural chasm that is about 10 yards wide and 20 yards deep. To gain entry into the citadel one had to cross the chasm 
with the help of a small wooden draw bridge which was drawn only after getting a signal from the sentries on the parapets that a friend was 
approaching.The naturally strong rock on which the fortress is located is further strengthened by the construction of embrasure walls and gateways 
along all possible shelves and precipitous edges. It forms the principal fortification. Seven gates have to be traversed before reaching the 
citadel. This citadel contains many important buildings apart from the living quarters of the royalty, like the stables, granaries, and meeting 
halls for the public, temples, mosques, shrines and pavilions jostling each other.
